# PACC

PACC enables you to use your Chromecast as an output device in Pulseaudio. This 
allows you to play music from your favorite player directly to your TV.

This is the Chromecast App. Once receiving the stream information from the
[Chrome App](https://github.com/pa2cc/pa_module/) it plays the music from your
[PulseAudio module](https://github.com/pa2cc/pa_module/).


## How to use

This app is hosted on <https://pa2cc.github.io/cast_receiver/>. It is
automatically launched on your Chromecast once your Chrome App initiates a
connection. You need to setup the PulseAudio module before using PACC.
Have a look at the [pa\_module  project](https://github.com/pa2cc/pa_module/)
for instructions.
