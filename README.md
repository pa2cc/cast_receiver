# PACC

PACC enables you to use your Chromecast as an output device in Pulseaudio. This 
allows you to play music from your favorite player directly to your TV.

This is the Chromecast app. Once receiving the stream information from the
[Chrome app](https://github.com/pa2cc/cast_sender/) it plays the music from your
PulseAudio PACC sink.


## How to use

This app is hosted on <https://pa2cc.github.io/cast_receiver/>. It is
automatically launched on your Chromecast once your Chrome app initiates a
connection.

Have a look at the [Chrome app](https://github.com/pa2cc/cast_sender) for
instructions how to use it.
